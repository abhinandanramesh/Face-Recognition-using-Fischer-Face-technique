function [m_database V_PCA V_Fisher ProjectedImages_Fisher] = FisherfaceCore(T)
% Use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) to determine the most 
% discriminating features between images of faces.
%
% Description: This function gets a 2D matrix, containing all training image vectors
% and returns 4 outputs which are extracted from training database.
% Suppose Ti is a training image, which has been reshaped into a 1D vector.
% Also, P is the total number of MxN training images and C is the number of
% classes. At first, centered Ti is mapped onto a (P-C) linear subspace by V_PCA
% transfer matrix: Zi = V_PCA * (Ti - m_database).
% Then, Zi is converted to Yi by projecting onto a (C-1) linear subspace, so that 
% images of the same class (or person) move closer together and images of difference 
% classes move further apart: Yi = V_Fisher' * Zi = V_Fisher' * V_PCA' * (Ti - m_database)
%
% Argument:      T                      - (M*NxP) A 2D matrix, containing all 1D image vectors.
%                                         All of 1D column vectors have the same length of M*N 
%                                         and 'T' will be a MNxP 2D matrix.
% 
% Returns:       m_database             - (M*Nx1) Mean of the training database
%                V_PCA                  - (M*Nx(P-C)) Eigen vectors of the covariance matrix of the 
%                                         training database
%                V_Fisher               - ((P-C)x(C-1)) Largest (C-1) eigen vectors of matrix J = inv(Sw) * Sb
%                ProjectedImages_Fisher - ((C-1)xP) Training images, which are projected onto Fisher linear space
