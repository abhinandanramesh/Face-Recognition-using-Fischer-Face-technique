function OutputName = Recognition(TestImage, m_database, V_PCA, V_Fisher, ProjectedImages_Fisher)
% Recognizing step....
%
% Description: This function compares two faces by projecting the images into facespace and 
% measuring the Euclidean distance between them.
%
% Argument:      TestImage              - Path of the input test image
%
%                m_database             - (M*Nx1) Mean of the training database
%                                         database, which is output of 'EigenfaceCore' function.
%
%                V_PCA                  - (M*Nx(P-1)) Eigen vectors of the covariance matrix of 
%                                         the training database

%                V_Fisher               - ((P-1)x(C-1)) Largest (C-1) eigen vectors of matrix J = inv(Sw) * Sb

%                ProjectedImages_Fisher - ((C-1)xP) Training images, which
%                                         are projected onto Fisher linear space
% 
% Returns:       OutputName             - Name of the recognized image in the training database.
